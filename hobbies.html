  <h1>Hobbies</h1>
  <hr>
  <h3>General</h3>
  <p>I often feel in this digital age that people only take a quick look at <br>
    your profile pic or home page and they figure they've got all the info they need. <br>
    If you've made it this far though, obviously you're not one of those people. So <br>
    here are some things that I enjoy:</p>
  <h3>Music</h3>
  <p>I started playing guitar when I was around 15. I played sports growing up but <br>
    this was the first time I felt I could truly excel and enjoy a hobby. Needless to say <br>
    that 15 years later, it's still pretty cool. I've worked with alot of <br>
    great people and although it's not my full time career, the people I've met <br>
    and the skills I've learned along the way make it worth while.</p>

  <br>
  <h3>Coding</h3>
  <p>Code was something that was suggested to me from a friend who worked in music. <br>
    He kept saying, "Code is music. You have fundamentals, theory, and creativity, <br>
    you're just using a different keyboard." After some other friends of mine who were <br>
    also in music got killer new jobs in the tech field, I knew I could too. Hundreds <br>
    of dollars and hours of Udemy lessons later, I'm here to land a killer new job <br>
    as well. </p>

  <br>
  <h3>Utah Jazz Basketball</h3>
  <p>I don't normally watch tv.. but when I do, it consists of me yelling at it <br>
    because the Jazz win in the regular season and blow our chances of <br>
    winning a championship in the playoffs. I know you are just as heartbroken <br>
    about this as I am. </p>

  <br>
  <h3>Cars</h3>
  <p>The skills of maintenancing a car seems to be more and more scarce. There's <br>
    a gift that resides in being able to diagnose, cause/effect, critically think <br>
    your way through an issue and cars are great examples. My 08 Accord with 200k <br>
    miles on it maybe went to the shop twice and honestly wish I hadn't have sold it. <br>
    There's a certain gratification that comes when you piece back together all your <br>
    parts, you have oil/grease/blood all over your hands and shirt and the new strut <br>
    is no longer going to cause your tire to wear unevenly. Saving money is also cool <br>
    because who enjoys going to the dealership? (The answer is no one.) </p>

  <br>
  <h3>Hot Wings</h3>
  <p>When I bought my house, my friend got me a Weber grill as a house warming gift. <br>
    Since then, I'd like to think I've mastered the charcoal wing technique. The trick is <br>
    to let your wings soak in milk for an hour prior to seasoning and marinating. <br>
    This helps the chicken retain the seasoning. Plus, you can't go wrong with that <br>
    sweet charcoal crunch. </p>
  <br>

  <br>
  <h3>Video Games</h3>
  <p>In the event that I'm not working, playing fetch with my dog, or sleeping, <br>
    it's nice to have some down time playing my Playstation 5. I don't play much <br>
    since I'm a grown up now, but it's definitely fun to saddle up my trusty steed <br>
    in Red Dead Revolver or lose all the time in Call of Duty because I don't have time <br>
    to be good at it anymore. </p>

  <br>
  <h3>In Conclusion:</h3>
  <p>If you couldn't tell, I like to stay busy. Learning a new skill or hobby <br>
    is always a beneficial component of life so.. That's what I do. </p>
